# SNP Identification and Impact Analysis
## Code Overview

The provided Python script `extract_snps` is designed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a set of sequences obtained from a BLAST analysis. Here's a breakdown of how the script works:

1. **SNP Identification**: The script reads a BLAST output file and parses it to extract information about aligned sequences. It identifies SNPs by comparing corresponding positions in the query and subject sequences.

2. **Storage of Subject Sequences**: Subject sequences containing SNPs are stored in a dictionary, with each subject ID mapped to its corresponding sequence.

3. **Output**: The script returns two main outputs:
   - `identified_snps`: A list of dictionaries, each containing information about a identified SNP, including the position, query base, and subject base.
   - `subject_sequences`: A list of dictionaries, each containing the subject ID and its corresponding sequence.

## Identification of SNPs
To identify SNPs within the PDC (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex) gene sequences, we utilized BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to align the query sequence against a reference sequence. The BLAST results were parsed to extract SNPs based on differences between the query and subject sequences. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **BLAST Analysis**: We performed a BLAST search using the query sequence against a reference sequence database.

2. **Parsing BLAST Results**: The BLAST output file was parsed to extract information about aligned sequences and identify regions of variation (SNPs) between the query and subject sequences.

3. **Identification of SNPs**: SNPs were identified by comparing corresponding positions in the query and subject sequences. If a mismatch was found, indicating a potential SNP, the position and the bases at that position were recorded.

4. **Storage of Subject Sequences**: Subject sequences containing SNPs were stored for further analysis. The sequences were stored in a dictionary, with each subject ID mapped to its corresponding sequence.

## Translation of DNA Sequences to Protein Sequences

To translate DNA sequences into protein sequences, we utilized the ExPASy Translate tool, which translates DNA sequences into amino acid sequences. Here's how the translation process was performed:

1. **Accessing ExPASy Translate Tool**: We sent HTTP POST requests to the ExPASy Translate tool endpoint, providing DNA sequences as input.

2. **Translation**: The tool translated the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences (protein sequences) using a specified output format (FASTA).

3. **Validation and Error Handling**: We validated the translated protein sequences to ensure they contained only valid amino acid characters. Any translation errors or invalid sequences were handled appropriately, and corresponding error messages were generated.

4. **Storage of Protein Sequences**: Valid protein sequences were stored in a list for further analysis and processing.

## Impact Analysis of SNPs on Protein Function

The impact of SNPs on protein function was assessed using computational prediction tools such as SIFT and PolyPhen. These tools predict the functional consequences of amino acid substitutions caused by SNPs. Here's how the impact analysis was conducted:

1. **Prediction Tools**: We utilized SIFT and PolyPhen to predict the impact of SNPs on protein function. These tools use sophisticated algorithms that consider factors such as protein structure, conservation, and physicochemical properties to make predictions.

2. **Interpretation of Results**: The predictions generated by SIFT and PolyPhen were interpreted to determine whether the SNPs were likely to be deleterious (damaging) or tolerated (non-damaging) based on the provided scores or classifications.
