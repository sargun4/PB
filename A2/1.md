Retrieve the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDC Gene Sequence:

Go to the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
Use the search bar to find the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDC gene sequence.
Download the DNA sequence of the PDC gene in FASTA format.
BLAST Analysis:

Go to the BLAST tool on NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).
Choose the appropriate database and input your downloaded PDC gene sequence.
Perform a BLAST search to compare the PDC gene sequence across different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains.
Analyze the results to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Translate the Gene Sequences:

Use a translation tool like ExPASy Translate tool (https://web.expasy.org/translate/) to convert the normal and SNP-containing PDC gene sequences into amino acid sequences.
Select a SNP:

Examine the SNPs identified during the BLAST analysis and select one for further analysis.
Predict the Impact of the SNP on Protein Function:

Utilize prediction tools such as SIFT (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/) or PolyPhen (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) to assess the potential impact of the selected SNP on the PDC protein function.
Input the amino acid sequence containing the SNP and follow the tool's instructions to obtain predictions.
Interpret the Results:

Evaluate the predictions obtained from SIFT or PolyPhen to understand whether the identified SNP is likely to impact the function of the PDC protein.
Consider the implications of this potential impact on CO2 production by yeast and its role in bread leavening and wine making
